EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The main objective of the CONVERGE project is the development of an innovative toolset combining
radio and vision-based communications and sensing technologies to enable an emerging area of research
aligned with the motto “view-to-communicate and communicate-to-view”, and through the integration
of this toolset, advance the state of the art of a set of Research Infrastructures (RIs), to the greatest extent
aligned with the ESFRI SLICES-RI.
This deliverable reports the first iteration in the definition of access modes and policies for the tools
developed by the CONVERGE project. These access modes and policies adhere to the best practices
used in established RIs, namely those considered in the ESFRI SLICES-RI. The SLICES-RI is therefore
used as a model to guide our discussion of access types, access modes, and access policies for the
CONVERGE tools.
The document also presents in detail the CONVERGE service-oriented architecture (its preliminary
version was presented in D1.1 – Requirements and use cases) which has been devised to be aligned with
a 5G network architecture. An example of a CONVERGE use case test session is then provided along
with a step-by-step flowchart and instructions for starting up and configuring the CONVERGE chamber.
The remainder of the interfaces, including the set of twelve CONVERGE Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs), is then presented with the associated attributes and parameters, following the 3GPP
design principles and guidelines.
This deliverable corresponds to the first version of the specification of access policies and interfaces. A
final version will be delivered by M18 (to be referenced as D1.3), where it is expected that both the
access policies as well as the CONVERGE interfaces will be described with more detail, allowing for
the beginning of the implementation planned within WP3.

1       INTRODUCTION
The main objective of the CONVERGE project is the development of an innovative toolset combining
radio and vision-based communications and sensing technologies to enable an emerging area of research
aligned with the motto “view-to-communicate and communicate-to-view”, and through the integration
of this toolset, advance the state of the art of a set of research infrastructures to the greatest extent aligned
with the ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) SLICES-RI (Scientific Large-
scale Infrastructure for Computing / Communication Experimental Studies - Research Infrastructures).
The toolset to be developed consists of (1) large vision-aided reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS),
in this context named as Large Intelligent Surface (LIS) enabling experimentation of massive MIMO
wireless communications and 3D positioning and environment sensing, (2) vision-aided fixed and
mobile 5G OAI base station (BS) enabling communications and experimentation with User Equipment
(UE)/mobile terminals, (3) a vision-radio simulator and 3D environment modeller to create a digital
twin allowing for experiment planning, as well as machine learning algorithms for processing
multimodal data, including communications signals, video streams, as well as radio frequency sensing
and network traffic traces. This toolset will be installed in experimental chambers and used by
experimenters (accessing it remotely or locally) to pre-configure the positions and mobility patterns of
mobile base stations, obstacles, and user equipment, configure test sessions and run experiments,
potentially involving humans, to gather vision-radio datasets.
The usage of the CONVERGE toolset shall be done via specific interfaces for each tool. Additionally,
a user interface is planned to be the main application enabling a researcher to access and interact with
the toolset. It will allow the user to access and configure individual tools, not only the physical tools
located in the CONVERGE chamber but also the virtual tools, namely the 3D environment modeller
and vision-radio simulator as well as the ML algorithms for dataset analysis, and will further include
configuration and trace collection functions. The configuration functions will allow setting-up the
toolset and the test sessions running on it; configuration may involve individual tools or a set of tools
cooperating in a given experiment or simulation. The trace collection functions will enable the
synchronised and space-referenced collection of traces and results from the tools which, in
CONVERGE, are varied and include visual or RF-based data streams from a multitude of cameras and
RF sensing, signal statistics such as signal to noise ratios, positioning of equipment, or traffic indicators
such as throughputs and frame delivery ratios. The trace collection functions consist of three main
components:
    •   Software probes, executed in the base stations, user equipment and large intelligent surface to
        gather specific time-stamped and space referenced traces and videos. These probes will act as
        trace/video publishers to a data broker associated with a high-performance database.
    •   High-performance data broker and database, executed at the premises of the experimental
        chamber or in the cloud. This data broker receives the timestamped information, stores it, and
        manages the access to the traces, including real-time subscription of the traces or the download
        of past traces.
    •   High-precision time synchronisation system, executed at each tool with trace generation
        capability, ensuring that traces are correctly timestamped prior to their publishing. High-
        precision time synchronisation is important for, not only, synchronising multiple traces
        originating from the same node, but also when using traces regarding the cooperative perception
        of multiple nodes.
This deliverable D1.2 reports the work made during the initial phase of Task T1.3: “Tool Access Modes
and Policies” and Task T1.4: “User and Tool Interface Specification”. The focus of T1.3 is the
establishment of the CONVERGE baseline access policies for the tools developed within the project.
Based on the example of the SLICES-RI, the aspects related to access types, access modes, and access
policies for the CONVERGE tools are discussed. The focus of T1.4 is on the design of a CONVERGE
service-oriented architecture, which is inspired in the 3GPP 5G core network architecture, accompanied

by its corresponding open APIs. The further developments of these tasks, after the delivery of the present
document D1.2, will be documented in D1.3, which is scheduled for delivery in M18.

2       CONVERGE TOOLS ACCESS MODES AND POLICIES
The access modes and policies are instrumental in allowing experimenters to have an impact using the
tools developed by CONVERGE. As we have defined since setting up the CONVERGE project: (i) the
access should follow the best practices in established RIs, such as those used in ESFRI, following the
FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, and taking into account the specific
access policies of the RIs involved in the project, and (ii) our task should study notably the opportunity
to propose the different types of access used by the SLICES-RI.
The SLICES-RI is in the Preparation phase of the ESFRI lifecycle, with work dedicated to defining the
SLICES user needs, services, access and training strategy. CONVERGE will benefit from regular
updates from the SLICES definitions. SLICES has already defined, during its design phase, the baseline
for its services and access modes and types, based on the analysis of the user requirements and three
examples of usage of the platform in the field of cloud/edge, IoT, and wireless/wired networking. On
this basis, SLICES has defined its access modes through the three types of offered interfaces, and with
the cases of the usage of some of its services in four basic and typical examples: a basic experiment, an
orchestrated experiment, a basic data-intensive experiment, and a basic course.
Based on the example of the SLICES-RI, CONVERGE tools must include in their specifications (as
part of final WP1 deliverable D1.3) the aspects related to the access: 1) Access types, 2) Access modes,
and 3) Access policy, as described below.
Access types
The tools developed by CONVERGE have to be compatible with the three types of access that will be
enabled through SLICES, in compliance with the access methods defined in the ESFRI 2020 white paper
for “Making Science Happen - A new ambition for Research Infrastructures in the European Research
Area” [1] as follows:
    •   Trans-national access (Physical access): Apart from accessing the equipment, the facilities and
        the laboratories, users will also be offered the required technical and scientific assistance to
        learn and use the infrastructure. Though such a type of access is more applicable to RIs that
        cannot be easily accessed remotely for fine-tuning, this is envisioned to facilitate experiments
        requiring physical presence at one of the SLICES sites, such as for instance Bring-Your-Own-
        Equipment (BYOE). In such experiments, researchers can install their prototype equipment at
        one of the SLICES sites and combine it in their experiments with the equipment offered by
        SLICES;
    •   Trans-national virtual access (Remote access): The majority of the tools and services that are
        designed and shall be developed for SLICES deal with the remote access method, in order to
        present to the users of the platform a unified solution for retrieving, selecting, reserving their
        experimental components and deploying their experiment on top of them. Through remote
        access, the users of the platform will take advantage of the tools for controlling their experiment
        and the environment parameters in an organized manner, under real world settings. This type of
        access is envisioned as the preferred method of access for the vast majority of SLICES users;
    •   Virtual access: Virtual access typically concerns access to data and digital tools. The provision
        of Virtual access to SLICES is aided through sophisticated cloud services and communication
        networks and allows for the remote access to repositories and archives of produced
        experimentation results. The vision of SLICES for allowing virtual access is to offer a pan-
        European operational networking and computer infrastructure to facilitate scientific research
        with instrumentation and experimentation capabilities.

Access modes
The CONVERGE tools will be in the same context for access modes as the SLICES-RI: mostly accessed
via the Internet in a remote fashion (remote access and virtual access modes) by users. Like in SLICES,
services will be computer provided and accessible through a dedicated web portal, including dedicated
APIs (through the planned REST software architecture), and, also in order to support experimentation
by users from research domains different from future Internet and distributed systems, high levels tools
such as Jupyter notebooks and workflow systems. Additionally, the CONVERGE tools should meet also
the three access modes described in the document “European Charter for Access to Research
Infrastructure” [2] of the European Commission:
    •   Excellence-driven;
    •   Market-driven;
    •   Wide.
Taking the example of how SLICES-RI envisage these three types of access: large academic
experiments are expected to access the platform under the “excellence-driven” mode while smaller scale
experiments will benefit from the “wide” mode. The “wide” access mode guarantees the broadest
possible access to scientific data and digital services provided by the Research Infrastructure to users
wherever they are based. Business and industry are mainly expected to access the platform under the
“market-driven” mode. Considering its user community, an initial estimation of SLICES is that
“excellence-driven” mode will represent 60% of the time platform, “wide” 20%, and “marked-driven”
20%, which seems to be also a good first estimation for the CONVERGE tools. SLICES has planned
that these numbers will be tightly monitored and communicated to the SLICES Supervisory Board. So
the CONVERGE project Steering Committee will be regularly informed of the updates for these
numbers. Similarly, for SLICES, the costs to access the platform for the “market-driven” mode are yet
to be discussed and decided. The two other modes, “excellence-driven” and “wide”, are, in the case of
SLICES, open and free of charge for European academics. If needed, calls for proposals—such as those
organized by PRACE for example— will be organized to allocate resources based on best usages by the
SLICES Access Committee. Considering that CONVERGE tools are expected to fit into nodes of
SLICES, the same adopted cost rules should be followed.
It should be noted that from a user point of view, accessing SLICES will share some similarities to
accessing existing digital infrastructure testbeds, although SLICES will offer a larger scale and more
diverse infrastructure as well as an advanced monitored and user-controllable infrastructure for
researchers in wireless/wired networking, IoT, Cloud, and distributed systems communities. The
CONVERGE tools have to take these elements into consideration in order to fit to SLICES and to other
ESFRI RIs.
Another point to be taken into account for the development of the CONVERGE tools is related with the
data produced through the use of the tools. As SLICES will be registered into the European Open
Science Cloud (EOSC) catalogue, the data produced and offered through SLICES will be annotated
appropriately, while SLICES will provide EOSC compatible mechanisms to easily access the platform
(authentication and authorization) and to manipulate data (EOSC FAIR mechanisms). The CONVERGE
tools should allow and facilitate the work to be done to meet these requirements.


Access policy
The access policy of any European research infrastructure should be built according to the "European
Charter for Access to Research Infrastructure" [2]. According to this Charter, “Research Infrastructures
should have a policy defining how they regulate, grant and support Access to (potential) Users from
academia, business, industry and public services”.
SLICES-RI has not yet built its access policy. It will definitely be built based on this Charter and by
benefiting from the expertise developed by the partners whilst operating research infrastructures.

 D1.2: Specification of interfaces and access policies                                     Page 13 of 71
 CONVERGE – Horizon Europe 101094831


SLICES has already stated that the policy will follow two principles: (i) Excellence-driven access
through the Access Committee selection, including a market-driven access for Industry, (ii) Global
approach and privileged access regardless of their location for all EU research groups, also open to other
institutions worldwide. SLICES also plans to open access for education and training purposes by
requesting special permissions to the Access committee.
The access to the CONVERGE tools will adhere to the SLICES policy, which envisages that:
    •   The elements for the implementation of its access policy will be:
             o   The access unit;
             o   The monitoring and accounting (users, resources, data);
             o   The ease of use through a RESTful API to control and interact with the infrastructure
                 management system;
             o   A clear and didactic documentation (including tutorials, hands-on, etc.).
    •   The envisioned access unit would be a slice, i.e., a time bounded and exclusive reservation of a
        set of resources. According to the resource kind (from an IoT device to a complete network/data
        centre, or a set or subset of tools in the specific case of CONVERGE), the duration may vary
        up from hours to several days;
    •   As technology allows a lot of flexibility regarding access, SLICES will also implement a Policy-
        based access that could embed constraints such as privacy concerns or industry usage. For
        example, in the case of a Market access by industry, a policy can keep the data or configuration
        private. Likewise, in the situation when the experiment manipulates data that can affect the
        privacy of an individual, specific policies can be enforced;
    •   The monitoring and accounting will be done on a per user basis and consolidated to capture
        research group, institutions usages or simply for charging costs. Such metrics are equally
        important to drive the evolution of the testbed;
    •   A one-stop shop solution will be provided through a single portal to request the identification
        of a user only once. This is mandatory, as users need to be traced back and identified in case of
        issues. A user first line support will also be developed to assist the experimenters in
        understanding the facility and developing their tests;
    •   Two levels of support will be provided, one central will be generic and provide the single point
        of presence of SLICES with its community of experimenters. It will be mostly suited to handle
        general questions, tutorials and basic access. A second line is considered with more advanced
        support if need be and will be shaped according to the main technological solutions deployed,
        namely cloud/compute, wireless or IoT, and including the CONVERGE tools;
    •   Tutorials, hands-on will be made available on-line and proposed during major conference events
        as well as dedicated SLICES schools for young researchers;
    •   As digital is a fast-moving field, the access policy is subject to evolution to adapt to new needs
        and usages. The tracking of needs and the adaptation of the policy will be managed by the
        SLICES management with the help of its user committee.


CONVERGE integration into SLICES Web Portal
The CONVERGE complete toolset comprised by the four tools: 1) vision-aided large intelligent surface,
2) vision-aided base stations and user equipment, 3) vision-radio simulator and 3D environment modeler
and 4) machine learning algorithms will be built into the University of Oulu laboratory as part of the
existing 5G Test Network (5GTN) RI as part of the work planned under WP3, namely T3.5 “Integration
and demonstration of the complete toolset”. University of Oulu is currently creating the environment to
achieve full integration of 5GTN into SLICES-SC, as part of the ongoing SLICES-SC project. The goal

 D1.2: Specification of interfaces and access policies                                       Page 14 of 71
 CONVERGE – Horizon Europe 101094831


of this integration is to connect the 5GTN to the SLICES-SC Web Portal to enable access and testing
through it, namely to enable the access to all 5GTN tech areas including 5G core, virtual compute nodes,
data storage, edge servers and also base Stations. When full integration of 5GTN to SLICES-SC is
achieved, the SLICES-SC Web Portal will be available to be used by CONVERGE project partners and
possible external users outside of the project to access the CONVERGE test environment remotely.
SLICES-SC web portal is to be used to identify the internal users and to know the identity of the external
users and grant access to the 5GTN test infrastructure (including CONVERGE tools). After the access
to SLICES-SC Web Portal is granted, the users need to create a test project within the Portal. Inside the
project users are then able to create their own test set-up based on the resources like compute nodes,
data storage and base stations that are made available by the 5GTN RI. It must be considered that
although the creation of the test setup can be done remotely, in some cases not all of the desired tasks
can be done remotely since the actual testing, depending on the test setup, often requires also manual
work by persons present at the test site. For example, the UEs normally need to be operated by a person.
Also, the test configuration involving available test equipment and software usually needs manual
configuration. Nevertheless, the possibility for remote use opens new possibilities for the CONVERGE
project to plan the tests and test setups remotely and at the same time open the test platform for possible
external use also. While the final Web Portal to be used by SLICES-RI in the long term is still under
specification as part of SLICES preparatory phase within the ESFRI lifecycle, the experience gained
with the 5GTN integration into the SLICES-SC portal will be important for steering the CONVERGE
developments and ensuring a successful integration of CONVERGE into SLICES-RI in the long term.

3     CONVERGE SERVICE-ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE
High-level architecture
The CONVERGE high-level architecture is shown in Figure 1 and consists of 3 main building blocks:
the CONVERGE Chamber, the CONVERGE Core, and the CONVERGE Simulator. The rationale for
this division stems from the fact that CONVERGE features both 1) a physical infrastructure (the
CONVERGE Chamber) where physical experiments using a combination of gNB, UE and LIS
equipment will be possible, including physical mobility of the equipment and 2) a simulator
infrastructure, where a digital twin of the Chamber can be used for planning experiments to be carried
out later in the CONVERGE Chamber, or for testing/extrapolating scenarios which are difficult or
impossible to test experimentally. Additionally, a third block is necessary for interfacing with the user
and controlling the physical or virtual experiments, for storing/retrieving datasets and ML models, as
well as enabling the training of ML models, the CONVERGE Core.
The CONVERGE research infrastructure will be accessible by external experimenters for the realisation
of real time (physical) experiments within the chamber or through off-line/virtual mode for the access
to the simulator component, ML tools and datasets. The different access modes of the CONVERGE
Chamber have implications on the APIs to be used during the test session, which are addressed in the
next sections where the different APIs are described.




                                Figure 1 – CONVERGE high-level architecture.


CONVERGE Chamber
The CONVERGE Chamber represents the experimental chamber to be developed in the project, which
will be deployed in different research infrastructure sites. In the chamber, there are three types of
equipment: the CONVERGE gNB, the CONVERGE UE, and the CONVERGE LIS. The CONVERGE
gNB will have functionality for controlling the placement of gNB (PCg in Figure 1), radio
communications functionality (RCg) defined for 5G gNB, functionality for radio sensing of gNB (RSg),
and functionality for vision sensing of gNB (VSg). The CONVERGE UE will have functionality for
controlling the placement of UE (PCue), radio communications functionality of UE (RCue) as defined
for 5G, functionality for radio sensing of UE (RSue), and functionality for vision sensing of UE (VSue).
The CONVERGE LIS will have functionality for controlling the placement of LIS (PClis), radio


 D1.2: Specification of interfaces and access policies                                      Page 16 of 71
 CONVERGE – Horizon Europe 101094831


communications functionality typical of a LIS (RClis), functionality for radio sensing (RSlis), and
functionality for vision sensing by taking advantage of video cameras installed in the LIS (VSlis).
In addition, the CONVERGE architecture can optionally have a functionality for video sensing of the
experiments taking place inside the Chamber (VSc). The CONVERGE Chamber equipment will be
connected and controlled by the CONVERGE Core building block.
To support remote user access for acquisition, visualization, and manipulation of radio and image data,
specific hardware platforms will be necessary. Existing FPGA-based Systems-on-Chip are good
candidate platforms. Specifically, AMD’s RF-SoC family provides a plethora of RF and other interfaces
under a Debian-like operating system that can be accessed remotely. The OS is hosted by the processor
side, which can include, among other things, Python environments. This allows for control and data
visualization via Jupyter servers [4], and also the use of well-known Machine Learning libraries (e.g.,
PyTorch), providing a low barrier to the use of the chamber tools, and allowing for researchers to
implement ML-based radio/image solutions with real-time data. Furthermore, the reconfigurability
aspect of these platforms, afforded by the integrated FPGA, brings an additional layer of
experimentation potential. Application-specific hardware designs can be offloaded to the FPGA, also
via Python calls, allowing researchers to deploy the computing blocks which comprise their solutions
or experiments. Significant productivity and cost benefits can be achieved by alleviating researchers the
nontrivial setup effort and by providing access to such platforms which would otherwise be prohibitively
expensive to acquire.


CONVERGE Core
The CONVERGE Core building block is responsible for controlling the operation of the equipment
located in the chamber and it consists of several functions. The CONVERGE Application Function
(CAF) will interface with users/experimenters that, through remote access from the internet and
according to specified access policies, enable them to configure, monitor, and control experiments to be
carried out in the CONVERGE infrastructure.
The management of a CONVERGE session will be performed by the CONVERGE Broker Function
(CBF) that will orchestrate the execution of a CONVERGE session carried out by actual equipment or
simulation tools, being also responsible for coordinating the storage of data resulting from a
CONVERGE session.
The CONVERGE Open Data Repository Function (CODRF) will store data generated by CONVERGE,
including open datasets and machine learning functions.
The CONVERGE Machine Learning Function (CMLF) will enable the access to the functions made
available by the machine learning tools developed in the project, including the training of models using
the collected datasets; these tools may be used by external users, CONVERGE equipment, or
CONVERGE Simulator tools.


CONVERGE Simulator
The CONVERGE Simulator building block consists of three simulation tools: the 3D Environment
Modeller (3D-S), the Vision Radio Simulator (VR-S), and the Network Simulator (NET-S). Together,
these tools will define the CONVERGE Digital Twin that will enable recreating digitally a physical
environment, modelling the radio and vision communications in the environment by using ray tracing-
like capabilities, and generating simulated traffic considering the realistic physical channel models
obtained by the above mentioned two tools. Sessions in the CONVERGE Simulator are expected to be
controlled also by the CONVERGE Broker Function and the simulations scripts and simulation results
are stored in the Open Data Repository Function.

 CONVERGE – Horizon Europe 101094831


Service-oriented architecture
The CONVERGE architecture will be, in fact, implemented as a service-oriented architecture aligned
with a 5G network architecture (Figure 2), and therefore based on 3GPP [3]. The main reasons for this
5G alignment include: 1) the need for basic 5G core network functionality required to support the
operation of UE and gNB, such as AMF, SMF and UPF, 2) the completeness and versatility of 3GPP
5G New Radio (5G NR) specifications which can be reused, and 3) the possibility of introducing the
new functions required to control the CONVERGE Chamber and the CONVERGE Simulator, aligned
with standard development.

In the CONVERGE control and sensing plane (cf. Figure 2, CONVERGE Core) the functionality to
accommodate traffic servers is added (CONVERGE Traffic Function) as well as servers for receiving
the radio sensing and vision information gathered from the CONVERGE equipment (CONVERGE
Video Function). Moreover, a set of new CONVERGE functions is added which will enable the simple
and direct control of the CONVERGE Chamber equipment and CONVERGE Simulator tools. These
control functions (CUECF, CLISCF, CgNBCF, CTCF, CODRF, C3DSCF, CVRSCF, and CNETSCF)
will be implemented as webservices (RESTful API) invoked by other functions. The detailed services
to be offered by each new CONVERGE function and the new interfaces are presented in Chapter 5.

Figure 2 shows the CONVERGE service-based architecture, followed by the identification of all
interfaces and functions.

CONVERGE vision-aided gNB aligned with O-RAN
Due to the relevance of the vision-aided gNB within the CONVERGE architecture, it is worth explaining
in greater detail its internal architecture. The communications functionality of the vision-enabled gNB
will be based on the O-RAN architecture [5], including its framework for supporting intelligent
controllers, as shown in Figure 3.




                 Figure 3 – CONVERGE vision-aided gNB architecture aligned with O-RAN.


O-RAN is an open and standardized architecture for the design and operation of mobile networks,
particularly focused on the Radio Access Network (RAN). It aims to promote interoperability and
flexibility in the design and deployment of 5G and beyond networks. The key components of O-RAN
architecture are:
    •   RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC): The RIC is a crucial part of the O-RAN architecture. It's
        responsible for implementing functions that traditionally reside in the baseband unit of the RAN.
    •   Central Unit (CU): The CU in O-RAN architecture is responsible for functions such as protocol
        termination, radio resource management, and support for higher-layer applications.
    •   Distributed Unit (DU): The DU handles functions like the physical layer processing of the radio
        interface, such as modulation and coding. It interfaces directly with the antennas.
    •   Open Fronthaul: O-RAN considers the use of standardized and open interfaces for the fronthaul
        connection between the DU and the CU (designated as Open FH in Figure 3). This allows for
        multi-vendor interoperability and flexibility in network design.
    •   xApps (External Applications): As will be explained below in greater detail, xApps are software
        applications that run on the RIC.



 D1.2: Specification of interfaces                                                          Page 20 of 71
 and access policies (initial)
 CONVERGE – Horizon Europe 101094831


    •   Open Interfaces: O-RAN defines open and standardized interfaces for communication between
        various network elements, including between the RIC and the CU/DU, and between different
        network functions.
    •   Virtualization and Orchestration: O-RAN supports virtualization technologies to allow for the
        flexible deployment of network functions.
    •   Multi-vendor Environment: O-RAN aims to break vendor lock-in by promoting a multi-vendor
        ecosystem.
    •   AI/ML Integration: The O-RAN architecture is designed to accommodate machine learning
        algorithms. These can be employed to optimize network performance and enable intelligent
        decision-making.
The essential components of the O-RAN architecture will be adopted in CONVERGE, including its
Radio Unit (O-RU), Distributed Unit (O-DU), and Centralized Unit (O-CU), aligned with the
standardized 3GPP F1 interface and the Open FH functional split 7.2 [3].
Vision-sensing capabilities will be added to the vision-aided gNB, represented by the video camera on
top of O-RU in Figure 3. The CONVERGE gNB will be jointly controlled and accessed via a web
service-based interface located in the CONVERGE Core and accessible via the Cgnb interface. The set
of web services to be offered to the remote users of this tool is yet to be defined but should enable the
validation of new xApps within the near-real time Radio Intelligent Controller (near-RT RIC) taking
advantage of multi-modal radio and vision information. An xApp is essentially a software application
that runs on top of a RIC platform, which is designed to leverage the capabilities and resources provided
by the RIC and are responsible for implementing specific functionalities or services that enhance the
operation of the RAN in a 5G network. The RIC is a part of the RAN infrastructure, and its primary
objective is to provide intelligent control and optimization functions for radio resources. The concept of
near-real time means that these operations occur with very low latency, implying that decisions and
actions can be taken quickly to adapt to changing network conditions. xApps within the near-real time
RIC can be used for several functions, such as:
    •   Orchestration and Control: xApps can orchestrate and control various aspects of the RAN, such
        as beamforming, power allocation, and mobility management.
    •   Resource Optimization: They can optimize the utilization of radio resources, ensuring that they
        are allocated efficiently based on the current network conditions.
    •   Quality of Service (QoS) Management: xApps can influence QoS parameters to ensure that
        different types of services (e.g., voice, video, data) receive appropriate levels of service quality.
    •   Intelligence and Analytics: xApps can use AI/ML algorithms to analyse data from the RAN and
        make intelligent decisions to improve network performance. These algorithms should be
        provided by the CONVERGE Machine Learning Function.
    •   Policy Enforcement: They can enforce network policies related to, for example, security,
        spectrum allocation, and interference management.

4      EXAMPLE OF A CONVERGE TEST SESSION
In this Chapter, we present an example of a CONVERGE test session where a researcher may be
experimenting with a vision-aided proactive beam-switching mechanism for 5G FR2 (Frequency Range
2 which includes frequency bands from 24.25 GHz to 71.0 GHz) that makes use of three CONVERGE
tools: Vision-aided gNB, LIS and ML algorithms. The goal of this example is to present the interactions
between different functions of the CONVERGE architecture and the interfaces required to implement
this test case.
In this use case an experimenter wants to test a vision-aided proactive beam-switching mechanism using
CONVERGE chamber as illustrated in Figure 4.

                                       CONVERGE chamber.

Beam failure happens when the UE experiences poor channel conditions, for instance, caused by a
sudden Line-of-Sight (LoS) blockage. Once the failure is detected, the gNB will restart the beam
sweeping process to reselect a suitable beam for the affected UE. This introduces delays and disruptions
in the 5G data link. To obviate this problem, visual data from video cameras such as RGB-D images
that capture various hidden features in wireless environments (e.g., object locations and mobility
patterns) can be exploited to anticipate the problem happening. In so doing, one can accurately predict
future mmWave channel conditions without consuming data resources to probe and estimate the radio
propagation channel. Based on video camera sensors deployed at the gNB, a machine-learning algorithm
can predict LoS signal blockage and trigger a vision-aided proactive switch to another beam to maintain
a stable connection. This use case can also benefit from RIS: before a blockage event occurs, the vision-
enabled gNB can switch to a beam directed at the RIS, which then reflects the mmWave signal towards
the UE.
Figure 5 shows a flow chart with the high-level step-by-step procedures required to startup and configure
the CONVERGE testbed for this test session.

The user starts by the login into the CONVERGE platform, to be authenticated and have access rights
to use the testbed and issue a start command to the testbed using the CONVERGE Application Function
(CAF). Then, the tester can issue a testbed start command to the CONVERGE Broker Function (CBF)
that in turn will issue separate starting commands to all the components that will be required for this use
case:
    •   CONVERGE gNB, the start command issued by the CBF is received in the CONVERGE gNB
        Core Function, CgNBCF, via Ncgnbf interface. After receiving a start command this function
        triggers starting actions of each of the individual CONVERGE gNB components, ensuring that
        the correct configuration is applied: near-NT RIC, O-CU, O-DU, O-RU and Camera Video
        Stream;
    •   CONVERGE LIS: receives a start command from the CBF and trigger actions in the internal
        LIS components;
    •   CONVERGE UE: receives a start command from the CBF and trigger actions in the internal
        UE components;
    •   CONVERGE Traffic Control Function (CTCF), after every other module has reported an online
        status, the CBF will issue a start data push to the CONVERGE Traffic Control Function that in
        turn will configure the CONVERGE Traffic Function (CTF), with relevant configurations to
        establish a data connection and data stream from the CTF to the CONVERGE User Equipment.
        Moreover, the Tester can take action upon the CTCF directly to manage the data flow, e.g.: stop
        data stream, and start data stream.
During the startup procedure, the user will have visual indications of the status of each individual task
being performed automatically by the CONVERGE Core and have a final visual indication that the
testbed has fully started.
After startup, the user can make a request for RAN data related to the running experiment, by issuing a
RAN data subscription request to CgNBCF. This request will establish a WebSocket as a transport layer
where the producer will be the near-RT RIC and the consumer will be the CONVERGE Web Interface,
where the user will be able to visualize and analyse the collected data in real time, or, download it for
further offline processing.
To modify the CONVERGE Chamber physically, hence modifying the radio channel conditions, by
introducing a LoS blocking element between the O-RU and the CONVERGE UE, the user will be able
to control an object via the CAF that will take direct action upon the XYZ robotic crane in the
CONVERGE Chamber and move the obstacle programmatically.
After the test is complete, the user should stop the operation of the testbed, by issuing a testbed shutdown
command from the CONVERGE Web Interface. This command will be received by the CBF and trigger
shutdown action commands for the modules relevant to the experiment: CONVERGE gNB
CONVERGE LIS and CONVERGE UE using the CONVERGE Core interfaces, Ncgnbf, Nclisf and
Ncuef.

5       SPECIFICATION OF THE CONVERGE CORE INTERFACES
CONVERGE follows a service-oriented architecture very much inspired in the 3GPP 5G CN (core
network) architecture.
The 3GPP 5G CN architecture is defined as service-based and the interaction between network functions
is represented in two ways:
    •     A service-based representation, where network functions (e.g., AMF) within the Control Plane
          enables other authorized network functions to access their services. This representation also
          includes point-to-point reference points where necessary.
    •     A reference point representation, shows the interactions that exist between the NF services in
          the network functions described by the point-to-point reference (e.g. N11) between any two
          network functions (e.g. AMF and SMF).
The 5G CN System Architecture contains the following service-based interfaces: Namf, Nsmf, Nnef,
Npcf, Nudm, Naf, Nnrf, Nnssf, Nausf, Nudr, Nudsf, N5g-eir and Nnwdaf.
The CN APIs in 3GPP is defined by OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications in YAML format, following
guidelines in 3GPP TS 29.501. The 3GPP TS 29.501 defines the designs principles and guidelines for
the 5G CN APIs. These principles should be followed when drafting 5G Service Based Interface
specifications. The APIs are defined by OpenAPI3.0.0 specification in YAML format. Following
sections present in details the new CONVERGE interfaces and their functionalities, following these
principles.

    5.1    Ncgnbf API

CgNBCF: CONVERGE dedicated gNB Control Function
Key responsibilities of the Ncgnbf interface
In the context of the CONVERGE service-oriented architecture, the CgNBCF is the CONVERGE gNB
Control Function, which enables the gNB Start/Stop, configuration, reconfiguration and data collection,
by exposing resources through a dedicated interface (API) named Ncgnbf.

Table 1 summarizes the resources made available by this service.


                           Table 1 - Resources made available by the service.

In the following we present examples of the use of the Ncgnbf API, showing the interaction between a
Service Consumer of the CgNBCF API and the CgNB for the operations CgNB start/stop (Figure 6) and
CgNB configuration (Figure 7).
The CgNB Control Start/Stop operation requires a gNB_ID path parameter that should match the gNB
ID of the testbed, then the CONVERGE gNB Core Function issues the start/stop command to the gNB
components via local Cgnb interface. If this operation is successful, a HTTP 200 ‘OK’ response is sent
to the consumer, or, if there are no match in the id path parameter a HTTP 404 ‘Not Found’ is sent to
the consumer.




    Figure 6 – CgNB start/stop: Interaction between a Service Consumer of the CgNBCF API and
                                              CgNBCF.

The CgNB configuration can be retrieved using the HTTP GET request, with the gNB_ID as a path
parameter that should match the gNB ID of the testbed, while using an HTTP Post Method, shall be
used to update the running configuration for the CgNB by adding the CgNDConfiguration object to the
Post request body payload. The response to both request types will contain the CgNBConfiguration
object if the request outcome is successful or a HTTP error indicator message if the request fails. The
CgNBConfiguration object is described in Table 2 – CgNBConfiguration Attributes.

CUECF: CONVERGE dedicated UE Control Function
In the context of the CONVERGE service-oriented architecture, the CUECF is the CONVERGE
dedicated UE control function.



Key responsibilities of the CUE
    1) Placement control: The position of the UE within the CONVERGE chamber may be
       controllable freely in a x-y-z coordinate system, allowing experimenters to evaluate the impact
       of different LIS positions within a certain communications, sensing or integrated
       communication and sensing scenario.
    2) Radio communications: Refers to the control of the UE, specifically for configuration aspects
       related to the resources available for communications.
    3) Radio sensing: Refers to the control of the UE that is specific to radio sensing applications.
       This allows for radio sensing resource configuration (e.g., radio sensing resource allocation)
       and radio sensing measurement configuration. This allows the UE to be instructed to, e.g.,

Service Operations

CUE Control Start/Stop operation requires a UE_ID path parameter that should match the UE ID in the
testbed. The CONVERGE UE Core Function then issues a start/stop command to the UE components
via local CUE interface. If this operation is successful, a HTTP 200 ‘OK’ response is sent to the
consumer. A failure in this procedure if there are no match in the id path parameter a HTTP 404 ‘Not
Found’ is sent to the consumer.
The full list of CUE telemetry parameters from 3GPP TS38.215 is described in detail in Annex 2.

   5.4    Nclisf API

CLISCF: CONVERGE dedicated LIS Control Function
In the context of the CONVERGE service-oriented architecture, the CLISCF is the CONVERGE Large
Intelligent Surface Control Function, which enables the control of experiments involving the LIS, by
exposing resources through a dedicated interface (API) named Nclisf.


Key responsibilities of the CLISCF interface
The interface of the CLISCF will enable to control the LIS in different aspects, namely:
    1) Placement control: The horizontal position of the LIS within the chamber (e.g. along a wall)
       may be controllable, allowing experimenters to evaluate the impact of different LIS positions
       within a certain communications, sensing or integrated communication and sensing scenario.
    2) Radio communications: This corresponds to the control of the LIS specifically for radio
       communications applications, allowing for the selection of pre-defined communications beams
       in terms of beam-width and beam target reflection angles, as well as fully customisable LIS
       phase profiles in order to enable maximum flexibility for less conventional research
       experiments. The control of a communications beam in real-time should be realised through
       multiple calls of this service along time.
    3) Radio sensing: This corresponds to the control of the LIS specifically for radio sensing
       applications, allowing for the configuration of fully customisable phase profiles with
       controllable time-varying characteristics, enabling maximum flexibility for the research
       community endeavours in this field of reconfigurable intelligent surface-aided sensing.

   5.5    Ncbf API

CBF: CONVERGE Broker, Session orchestration, data management
In the context of the CONVERGE service-oriented architecture, the CBF is the CONVERGE Broker
Function, that will orchestrate the execution of a CONVERGE session carried out by equipment or
simulation tools, being also responsible for coordinating the storage of data resulting from a
CONVERGE session.
Key responsibilities of the NCBF interface
The interface of the NCBF will enable to coordinate the experiments, namely:
    1) gNB Management: configure the placement, radio communicatins and radio sensing of the gNB.
       It also enables to upload and get the status of an x-APP running on the gNB.
    2) UE Management: configure the placement, radio communicatins and radio sensing of the UE.
    3) LIS Management: configure the placement, radio communicatins and radio sensing of the LIS.
    4) Traffic Control Function Management: configure the parameters of the CONVERGE Traffic
       Control Function.
    5) Simulation Session Management: configure the parameters for the 3D-S, VR-S and NET-S
       simulators.
    6) Open Data Repository Management: responsible for retrieving ad uploading a dataset from/to
       the CONVERGE Open Data Repository.
    7) Machine Learning Algorithms: allows to retrieve and upload a Machine Learning model.
    8) Experiment status: allows to get the current experiment status.

CTCF: CONVERGE Traffic Servers Control Function
The CTCF is part of the CONVERGE Core building block, allowing configuration and management of
the data flow, e.g.: stop data stream, and start data stream.
Key responsibilities of CTCF interface:
    1) Traffic Steering Control: CTCF is tasked with directing and optimizing user plane traffic within
       the CONVERGE Chamber. It leverages predefined rules and policies to determine how the
       different types of traffic should be handled as they move between the CONVERGE gNB,
       CONVERGE UE, and CONVERGE LIS equipment.

    2) Interfacing with CONVERGE Core: CTCF collaborates closely with other functions within the
       CONVERGE Core to ensure seamless connectivity and control over the equipment within the
       chamber. It communicates with the CONVERGE Application Function (CAF), CONVERGE
       Broker Function (CBF), and other control functions to coordinate and manage traffic providing
       access to 5G traffic that can be used with the different tools.
    3) Rule-Based Traffic Policies: CTCF operates based on a set of predefined traffic steering rules,
       which specify how traffic types, source networks, destination networks, and priorities should be
       managed. These rules are essential for optimizing resource allocation and ensuring quality of
       service.
    4) Real-time Data Handling: CTCF facilitates real-time data handling, allowing for dynamic
       adjustments to traffic routing based on current network conditions, user demands, and
       experimental requirements.
    5) Integration with CONVERGE Simulator: CTCF may also interact with the CONVERGE
       Simulator building block to simulate traffic scenarios, enabling researchers to conduct
       experiments in controlled environments.
In the following we provide a summary of the resources made available by this service, as well as a list
of attributes for the parameters envisioned to be exchanged via the API.


                        Table 34 - Resources made available by the CTCF service.

Service Operations:
Traffic Control Start/Stop Operation: This operation requires a CTCF_ID path parameter that should
match the CTCF ID of the service instance. The CTCF issues start/stop commands to control traffic
servers via a local interface. If the operation is successful, an HTTP 200 'OK' response is sent to the
consumer. If there is no match in the ID path parameter, an HTTP 404 'Not Found' response is sent to
the consumer.
The following example displays the CTCF Configuration object.
Traffic Control Rules Configuration: The current traffic control rules configuration can be retrieved
using an HTTP GET request with the CTCF_ID as a path parameter. To add or modify traffic control
rules, use an HTTP POST request with the CTCF_ID as a path parameter and include the traffic control
rules in the request body payload. The response to both request types will contain the traffic control
rules if the request outcome is successful, or an HTTP error indicator message if the request fails.
The CTCF defines traffic control rules with specific attributes that dictate how traffic is managed. These
attributes include:

CMLF: CONVERGE Machine Learning Function

In the context of the CONVERGE service-oriented architecture, the CONVERGE Machine Learning
Function (CMLF) is part of the CONVERGE core, developed to facilitate the processing of
heterogeneous datasets (e.g., video and radio sensing data) produced by the CONVERGE project, as
well as those provided by the scientific community. The CMLF provides Machine Learning tools
specifically engineered to process and analyse multimodal information to enable new approaches to the
paradigm " view-to-communicate" and "communicate-to-view".

Key responsibilities of the CMLF interface:

The interface of the CMLF enables the use, implementation, uploading and downloading of algorithms
and data processing techniques, namely:

         1) Machine Learning Model Training. This function is called to act as a tool to train the
            Machine Learning model.
         2) Model execution in CONVERGE Chamber. Call to the prediction function of the (public)
            models hosted at the CONVERGE chamber and execution of the model for remote
            prediction in the user's servers.
         3) Model Uploading and Downloading functionality. Functionality that will allow the user to
            upload and download pre-trained models for later use
         4) Pre-trained model inventory. Allows the user to know a complete list of available digital
            components.
         5) In any of the above cases, a secure interaction between internal and/or external elements
            of the CONVERGE chamber must be established during the initialization.

   5.8    Ncodrf API

CODRF: CONVERGE Open Data Repository Function
In the context of the CONVERGE service-oriented architecture, the CODRF is the CONVERGE Open
Data Repository Function, which enables the storage and retrieval of data generated by CONVERGE.
It is implemented as a service operating between the CAF and CBF as noted in the high level architecture
and exposes resources through a dedicated interface (API) named Ncodrf.


Key responsibilities of the CODRF interface
The interface of the CODRF will enable different dataset storage/retrieval operations, namely:
    1) Creation/storage of datasets. This corresponds to the creation/storage or update of a dataset
       consisting of radio and/or vision data collected from experiments carried out in the
       CONVERGE chamber or data collected from the CONVERGE simulator, along with the
       appropriate metadata (e.g. readme file, data annotation, experimental/simulation conditions).
    2) Creation/storage of ML models. This corresponds to the creation/storage or update of trained
       ML models, along with the required metadata (namely the identifier of the dataset that was used
       for training the model).
    3) Retrieval of datasets and ML models. This corresponds to the service of data retrieval for both
       stored datasets and ML models.


Types of data
The data to be handled by the CODRF interface will consist mainly of open data, and include the
following types:
    •    Experimental data:
             o Logs from gNBs, UEs and LIS (text or various binary formats)
             o Raw signals from gNBs, UEs and cameras, including time stamped radio streams (IQ
                 samples) and video streams (various binary formats)
    •    Simulation data: corresponds to data produced within the digital twin component, which
         includes 3D modelling data, and radio simulation data (ray tracing and network level).
    •    Model data: corresponds to trained ML models obtained after training within the CMLF (various
         binary formats).


Services operations
In the following we provide a summary of the resources made available by this service.

   5.9    Nnetsf API

CNETSCF: CONVERGE Network Simulator Control Function
In the context of the CONVERGE service-oriented architecture, the CNETSCF is the CONVERGE
Network Simulator Control Function, which enables the control of network simulations, by exposing
simulation resources through a dedicated interface (API) named Nnetsf. The simulation resources
include the digital models of the CONVERGE network elements such as the gNB and the UE, but also
important auxiliary components such as the Propagation Loss Models and Traffic Generation
Applications. These resources allow the CONVERGE Network Simulator to be used as a “Sandbox” of
the real CONVERGE chamber, allowing the experimenters to test their developments in a simulated
setting without depending on the CONVERGE Chamber availability. This CONVERGE Network
Simulator can also be seen as a Digital Twin of the real environment, since its models (such as ML-
based Propagation Loss Model) will learn and adapt to the traces captured in the real CONVERGE
Chamber.

Key responsibilities of the CNETSCF interface
The interface of the CNETSCF will enable to control the Network Simulator in different aspects,
namely:
   1) Simulated placement control: As in the case of the real gNB, the positioning of the simulated
        gNB is fully controllable, allowing it to be set in a fixed (fixed BS) or mobile (mobile BS)
        configuration along X, Y, Z coordinated. The placement of the UE is also controllable, allowing
        the experimenters to perform network simulations to evaluate the impact of the relative
        positioning between the gNB and UE, accounting also to their mobility patterns.
    2) Simulation setup: This corresponds to the configuration of the simulated scenario, including the
       Propagation Loss Model, the Mobility Model, the Network Configuration and Traffic
       Generation.
    3) Simulation orchestration: This corresponds to the control of the start and the stop of the
       simulations. It also can be used to configure the simulations duration, the random variable seeds
       and the number of iterations.
    4) Simulation data collection: This corresponds to the collection of the performance results (e.g.
       throughput, packet loss, RTT, etc), mobility traces and radio traces and events that are logged
       during the simulations.

   5.10 Nvrsf API

CVRSCF: CONVERGE Vision Radio Simulator Control Function
The CVRSCF is a critical element of the CONVERGE high-level architecture, serving as a key
component responsible for managing and orchestrating simulation experiments within the CONVERGE
anechoic chamber. The VR-S API is part of the CONVERGE simulator building block, which consists
of a ray-tracing based simulation tool that employs wave reflections models from 3.5 GHz to 28 GHz
on environmental surfaces. Both 3D simulated models and real-world measurement-based scenes are
supported. The simulator uses 3D models of a real experimental chamber featuring configurations that
the user can modify. The simulator also supports configurable models of radio transmitters and receivers,
as well as imaging equipment such as visible light, infrared cameras, and 3D scanners. Therefore,
graphical rendering tools can be used to create rich visualizations in the electromagnetic domain, in
addition to simulated camera views and/or real camera views augmented with measurement data.

Key responsibilities of the CVRSCF interface
The configuration interface of the vision-radio simulator will allow to take advantage of both planned
and exploratory modes:
    1. Planned: the simulator allows for setting known trajectories and speeds of the obstacles
       (including a simulated person), radios and cameras. This allows for producing simulated
       synchronised video and radio channel data in predetermined dynamic situations. At selected
       points the trajectories and radio parameters are made to match with and are calibrated against
       the prior measurement traces from the real-world chamber experiments. The results provide data
       for the automated learning of view-to-communicate algorithms that infer environment
       information from 2D views, 3D sensor or 360° video.
    2. Exploratory modes: the environment is static, while simulated mobile radios and cameras are
       controlled by a machine learning system. The aim is to gather information of the environment
       in a communicate-to-view mode, using multipath radio signal propagation data in order to direct
       cameras to acquire environmental information. This mode requires calibration data from
       measurements in the experimental chamber.

C3DFCF: CONVERGE 3D Simulator Control Function
The CONVERGE 3D Simulator is a central component of the CONVERGE high-level architecture,
dedicated to generating electromagnetics augmented 3D environment models specifically for the vision-
radio simulator. Nested within the CONVERGE simulator framework, the 3D-S tool specializes in the
creation of detailed point-cloud models (and alternatively 3D triangle mesh models), representing both
the environment and associated radio behaviour. The 3D simulator efficiently maps radio signals and
their propagation models within this geometric space, providing the raytraced paths of electromagnetic
signals as the interact with the environment in terms of reflection, diffraction, and optionally refraction
and diffuse scattering. The simulator is also equipped to model data flows, sourcing inputs from a variety
of sensors such as cameras, radios, and lidars, and then integrating them into its 3D geometry
construction processes in an asynchronous manner. In this context, the simulator provides an accurate
digital twin of the physical environment, allowing for swift reconfigurations based on real-world data
flows, including those from installed cameras and communication equipment. Moreover, digital twin
can be enhanced with selected 360° live or recorded camera views with simulated or measured sensor
data.
Key Responsibilities of the C3DFCF interface
    1. Model Creation: The simulator creates point-cloud models. It uses both direct 3D methods like
       LiDar and indirect ones such as Camera-based reconstructions. The 3D model of the chamber
       provides a complete view of it from any position, and has limited support for configuring
       moving objects and trajectories. The geometrical model incorporates labels for each point and
       object that considers its characteristics in terms of reflection, diffraction, and absorption, and it
       offers limited support for refraction and diffuse scattering.
    2. Mapping Radio Signals: The simulator uses parallel processing with platforms to compute
       approximate radio path propagations, based on the location of the receiver and transmitter. It
       uses different models based on resolution needs, from triangle counts to ray launches, and can
       model different beamforming approaches.
    3. Sensor Data Flow Modelling: The simulator re-models the environment using real data flows
       and measurements from the physical chamber, using the available camera network and the
       vision-radio tools (UE, BS, LIS).

   5.12 Ncvf API

CVCF: CONVERGE Video Control Function
The CVCF is responsible for handling the video camera network that is used to support other
CONVERGE tools. It should enable the researcher the possibility to configure and use the video
component of the tools (the video cameras installed in the chamber as well as in the different tools: gNB,
UE and LIS) and be as flexible as possible.
Key Responsibilities of the CVCF interface
The interface of the CVCF will enable to control the CONVERGE video cameras and real-time vision
models in different aspects, comprising the following functionalities:
    1. Management of the cameras, including its configuration. The configuration allows the user to
       associate labels/ids to each camera, define the parameters of its outputs (resolution, framerate,
       modality, etc), and enable/disable image compression. Additionally, the user can start/stop the
       streaming or recording (directly on a server) of each camera.

    2. Management of the support vision models, which consist of ML models that can be used to
       extract high-level semantic information from the scene being captured by the cameras.
       Examples of such models are person/object tracking, 3D posture estimation and scene
       classification. The models are trained outside the scope of this API and are available as a service.
       The configuration of each support vision model defines the model endpoint, the supported inputs
       (e.g. camera/source and type) and the model outputs (type).

6       CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
This deliverable reports a first definition of access modes and policies for the tools developed by the
CONVERGE project following the best practices used in established RIs, such as those used in ESFRI
SLICES-RI. Based on the example of the SLICES-RI, the aspects related to access types, access modes,
and access policies for the CONVERGE tools were identified and discussed. Since SLICES-RI is still
in its preparation phase, experimenter access APIs and policies are still being specified, although some
general principles have already been defined such as the consideration of a RESTful API to control and
interact with the infrastructure management system. These access policies will be tightly monitored by
CONVERGE in order to align the interfaces and prepare a smooth integration of most of its RIs into
SLICES-RI in the medium term. The University of Oulu is currently working on the integration of 5GTN
RI into the SLICES-SC Web Portal, which will also enable the access to the CONVERGE tools, and
this will be a valuable experience for ensuring the long-term integration of CONVERGE into the
SLICES-RI.
The CONVERGE service-oriented architecture was presented, and its design aligned with a 5G Network
architecture was justified. An example of a CONVERGE use case test session was described with the
step-by-step flowchart and procedures required to startup and configure the CONVERGE chamber for
an experiment. A set of twelve CONVERGE core APIs were also presented, with associated attributes
and parameters, following the 3GPP design principles and guidelines.
The work presented in this document is an ongoing activity pertaining to tasks T1.3 and T1.4 and will
continue until M18. The results of these tasks will be later reported in D1.3. The envisioned next steps
until then include further work on the definition of the access policies as well as on the definition of the
interface APIs, according to the following considerations:
    •   The access policies will be defined per service and per category of user, using the definition of
        the services and users produced by the CONVERGE use cases and further refined by each tool
        definition. Links with SLICES-RI will be further elaborated and exploited. The CONVERGE
        facilities will position themselves with respect to the SLICES access policies and guidelines.
    •   Each CONVERGE site (Porto, Oulu and Sophia Antipolis) will define the specific use cases to
        be implemented and tested in the context of WP3. Based on each use case, D1.3 will specify in
        detail the modules involved and required APIs. Interaction with WP3 is expected on the
        definition of the user interface, which at least will provide access to the functionality required
        to support each of the use cases. D1.3 will detail the interfaces identified in D1.2 using OpenAPI
        3.0.0 and following the 3GPP design principles.
